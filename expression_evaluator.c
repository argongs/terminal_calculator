/*
Checks whether a operator has been appropriately used OR not in the 
infix expression. What does appropriate usage mean?
operand operator operand -> this is appropriate usage of operator
operator operator operator OR operator operator operand OR
operand operator operator -> these are all inappropriate
So how does the checking happen?
If the 'i'th index of the array (which holds the infix expression)
contains an operator, then the 'i-1'th & 'i+1'th index should contain 
an operand. Note that this operand can either be a no./constant (such as 'pi' OR 'e') 
OR it can be a part of bigger operand. Bigger operand?
Consider the following example :
Index   : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
element: ( 4 + 3 ) * 6
Over here, the * operator has 2 operands : (4+3) and 6. Since we 
represent the infix expression via an array therefore, ')' is
the symbol that will be present in the immediate LHS of *.
And the presence of ')' indicates that a 'bigger operand' is present
in the LHS of '*'. So basically, a bigger operand is nothing but an 
operand composed of another expression and enclosed by parantheses.
And the only way we can understand that an operator is using a bigger 
operand by looking at those parantheses. Presence of a closing 
paranthesis on the LHS indicates the possible presence of a bigger 
operand on the LHS. Similarly, presence of '(' on the RHS indicates 
the presence of bigger operand on the RHS. But anything apart from
this cannot be considered as an appropriate representation of
big operand.
One may ask that based on the above logic, won't ')*(' also be 
considered as an expression?
Good question! The answer is NO. There are other checks put in place
to specifically take care of extra parantheses.

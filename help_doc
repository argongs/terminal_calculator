--------------------------
1. Direct operation mode :
$ ./compute [options] [real numbers seperated by <space>]

2. Expression mode :
$ ./compute [mathematical expression]

3. Information mode :
$ ./compute [about]

[options]:
 -a	Perform addition.
 -m	Perform multiplication.
Examples :
$ ./compute -a 1 -2.3 3.45 -4.567 # equivalent to 1.1-2.3+3.45-4.567
$ ./compute -m 1 -2.3 4.5 # equivalent to 1*(-2.3)*4.5

[mathematical expression]:
-Any mathematical expression that can be created by using the supported operators.
The supported operators are : + - * / ^
Examples:
$ ./compute 1+2 
$ ./compute 1+2*3 

[about]:
 -h	Obtain the usage section and other helpful examples
 -v	Obtain version of this program
 -b	Obtain brief description of this program
 
Points to keep in mind :
------------------------
-Parenthesis is allowed, but only in the expression mode. Use it as much as you want in that mode. However enclose the expression in quotes i.e. '', whenever you wish to make use of the Parenthesis.
Examples:
Correct usage - 
$ ./compute '(1+2)' 
$ ./compute '(1+2)*3'
Incorrect usage -
$ ./compute (1+2) 
$ ./compute (1+2)*3

-The operators are evaluated according to the following precedence rule (high to low):
 Parenthesis > Exponential > Division > Multiplication > Addition > Subtraction

-Euler's constant and Pi are availible in ready to use format. Euler's constant can be used by making use of 'e' and Pi can be used by making use of 'pi' in the expression as well as direct operation mode.
In expression mode :
$ ./compute pi+e 
$ ./compute '(e+pi)*90'
In direct operation mode :
$ ./compute -a pi ~e 1 2
$ ./compute -a ~pi e
$ ./compute -m ~pi 4 4
$ ./compute -m ~e 3 4  
Notice the presence of '~' character in the direct operation mode. What does it indicate?
It indicates negative sign. It's meant to be used only with the constants and that too in the direct operation mode. It helps the program to capture negative constants. Note that this character is illegal in the expression mode. There's no need to use this sign in expression mode since regular representation of minus sign i.e. '-' character works perfectly over there for both numbers as well as constants.

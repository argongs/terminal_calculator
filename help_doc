1.	.\compute [options] [positive real nos seperated by <space>]
2.	.\compute [mathematical expression]
3.	.\compute [about]

[options]:
	-a	Perform addition.
	-m	Perform multiplication.
	
[mathematical expression]:
	-Supported operators : + - * / ^
	Examples:
	1+2, 1+2*3 
	-Paranthesis is allowed. Use it as much as you want. However
	enclose the expression in quotes i.e. '', if you wish to make use 
	of the paranthesis.
	Examples:
	Allowed - '(1+2)', '(1+2)*3'
	Not allowed - (1+2), (1+2)*3
	-Note that the operators will be evaluated according to the following 
	precedence rule (high to low):
	Paranthesis > Exponential > Division > Multiplication > Addition > Subtraction
	-Euler's constant and Pi are availible in ready to use format.
	Euler's constant can be used by making use of 'e' in the expression and Pi
	can be used by making use of 'pi' in the expression
	Examples:
	1+e, e*pi, (e+pi)*90

--------------------------
1. Direct operation mode :
$ ./compute [options] [real numbers seperated by <space>]

2. Expression mode :
$ ./compute [mode] [mathematical expression]

3. Information mode :
$ ./compute [about]

[options]:
 -a	Perform addition.
 -m	Perform multiplication.
Examples :
$ ./compute -a 1 -2.3 3.45 -4.567 # equivalent to 1.1-2.3+3.45-4.567
$ ./compute -m 1 -2.3 4.5 # equivalent to 1*(-2.3)*4.5

[mode]:
 -d enable degree mode
- This option will force the program to change the unit of the input given to the trigonometric functions to 'degrees'. Otherwise the default unit is 'radians' for the input of trigonometric functions.  
Examples :
$ ./compute -d 'cos(45)' #equivalent to cos(45 degrees)
$ ./compute 'cos(45)' #equivalent to cos(45 radians)

[mathematical expression]:
- Any mathematical expression that can be created by using the supported operators.
The supported operators are : + - * / ^
Examples:
$ ./compute 1+2 
$ ./compute 1+2*3 

[about]:
 -h	Obtain the usage section and other helpful examples
 -v	Obtain version of this program
 -b	Obtain brief description of this program
 
Points to keep in mind :
------------------------
- Parentheses are allowed, but only in the expression mode. Use it as much as you want in that mode. However enclose the expression in quotes i.e. '', whenever you wish to make use of the parentheses.
Examples:
Correct usage - 
$ ./compute '(1+2)' 
$ ./compute '(1+2)*3'
Incorrect usage -
$ ./compute (1+2) 
$ ./compute (1+2)*3

- The operators are evaluated according to the following precedence rule (high to low):
 Parenthesis > Exponential > Division > Multiplication > Addition > Subtraction

- Euler's constant and Pi are availible in ready to use format. Euler's constant can be used by making use of 'e' and Pi can be used by making use of 'pi' in the expression as well as direct operation mode.
  i. In expression mode :
     $ ./compute pi+e 
     $ ./compute '(e+pi)*90'
 ii. In direct operation mode :
     $ ./compute -a pi ~e 1 2
     $ ./compute -a ~pi e
     $ ./compute -m ~pi 4 4
     $ ./compute -m ~e 3 4  
 Notice the presence of '~' character in the direct operation mode. What does it indicate?
It indicates negative sign. It's meant to be used only with the constants and that too in the direct operation mode. It helps the program to capture negative constants. Note that this character is illegal in the expression mode. There's no need to use this sign in expression mode since regular representation of minus sign i.e. '-' character works perfectly over there for both numbers as well as constants.

- If you wish to use negative nos. in the expression, then make sure to enclose each and every negative no. in parentheses to ensure correct evaluation. Otherwise, the program might consider your input as invalid.
Examples:
Correct usage - 
$ ./compute '1*(-2)' 
$ ./compute 'e^(-1)'
Incorrect usage -
$ ./compute 1*-3
$ ./compute e^-1

- The following functions can be directly made use of in the expression mode :
  i. Trigonometric functions -
     - sin(), cos()& tan()
     - Examples :   
       ./compute 'sin(pi)+cos(pi)'
       ./compute 'tan(sin((cos(pi))))'
 ii. Logarithmic functions -
     - log2() loge() log10() (representing log at base 2, e and 10 respectively) 
     - Examples :
       ./compute log10(100)
       ./compute log2(1024)/loge(e^2)
   
  Note that the trigonometric functions treat the unit of the input angles as 'radians' by default.
